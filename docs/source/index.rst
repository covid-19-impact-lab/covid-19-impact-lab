CoViD-19 Impact Lab
===================

CoViD-19 Impact Lab was started in mid-March 2020 by a group of economists at
Bonn and now consists of students and more senior researchers from several
institutions like the University of Mannheim, the University of Lausanne,
Tilburg University, and the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA).

To assess how CoViD-19 is impacting individuals, households, and communities, we were running a panel data
collection in the Netherlands, thereby facilitating near-real-time monitoring
of how people respond to the CoViD-19 crisis. On the one hand, we aim to
quickly generate insights from contemporaneous data and communicate them
to decision-makers and the public. On the other hand, we will continue to provide in-depth
analyses of mechanisms using microeconomic and microeconometric methods.

In our first papers, we look at the driving forces of working hours reductions, job search and mental health during a pandemic recession. In a simulation model, we explore the effects of different containment policies on infection numbers.
Our work is featured under :ref:`publications`.

Our results have been mentioned in several important media outlets like
Die Zeit (2021-01-14), Die Süddeutsche (2021-01-19),
`Deutsche Welle <https://bit.ly/38I3cuc>`__ and
`Tagesschau <https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/sendung/ts-41135.html>`__.

We describe the data we are using and especially the data set we collected under :ref:`datasets`. Documentation to our questionnaires is made available `here <https://liss-covid-19-questionnaires-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__. For further details also `explore our
