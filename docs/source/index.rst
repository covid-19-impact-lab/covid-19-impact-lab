CoViD-19 Impact Lab 
===================

CoViD-19 Impact Lab was started in mid-March 2020 by a group of economists at
Bonn and now consists of students and more senior researchers from several
institutions like the University of Mannheim, the University of Lausanne,
Tilburg University, and the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA).

CoViD-19 and what it means for us personally, our loved ones, the economy, and
society in general is on everyone’s mind. To assess how CoViD-19 is impacting
individuals, households, and communities, it is important to know what the
population as a whole knows, believes, and how people behave in response to
the current pandemic. In order to gain insights, we are running a panel data
collection in the Netherlands, thereby facilitating near-real-time monitoring
of how people respond to the CoViD-19 crisis. On the one hand, we aim to
quickly generate first insights from contemporaneous data and communicate them
to decision-makers and the public. On the other hand, we will provide in-depth
analyses of mechanisms using microeconomic and microeconometric methods.

Our first such paper reveals that the ability to work from home and essential
worker status are key predictors of working hours reductions early in the
crisis, but much less so in May and June. For further details `explore our 
data <https://covid-19-impact-lab.iza.org/en/app>`__. Current and future work
will be featured under :ref:`publications`.
