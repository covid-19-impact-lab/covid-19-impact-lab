COVID-19 Impact Lab
===================

The current crisis forced decision-makers to take decisions with far-reaching consequences without a reliable foundation in March 2020. Our primary goal is to get helpful insights from empirical data and to communicate them as quickly as possible to the public and decision-makers. We leave the medical topics to the experts and focus on the effect of the crisis and measures to combat it on people's behavior, fears and beliefs. Secondly, we will provide in-depth analyses of the data in order to better prepare for other crises.

Covid-19 impact lab was initiated by a group of economists at Bonn. While our research projects usually take months or years to materialize, the situation in March 2020 prompted us to combine efforts in order to speed things up.
