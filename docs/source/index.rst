CoViD-19 Impact Lab 
===================

CoViD-19 Impact Lab was started in mid-March 2020 by a group of economists at
Bonn and now consists of students and more senior researchers from several
institutions like the University of Mannheim, the University of Lausanne,
Tilburg University, and the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA).

CoViD-19 and what it means for us personally, our loved ones, the economy, and
society in general is on everyone’s mind. To assess how CoViD-19 is impacting
individuals, households, and communities, it is important to know what the
population as a whole knows, believes, and how people behave in response to
the current pandemic. In order to gain insights, we are running a panel data
collection in the Netherlands, thereby facilitating near-real-time monitoring
of how people respond to the CoViD-19 crisis. On the one hand, we aim to
quickly generate first insights from contemporaneous data and communicate them
to decision-makers and the public. On the other hand, we will continue to provide in-depth
analyses of mechanisms using microeconomic and microeconometric methods.

Our first such paper reveals that the ability to work from home and essential
worker status are key predictors of working hours reductions early in the
crisis, but much less so when economic restrictions are lifted during the summer. We also show that household income in the Netherlands is much less affected than in other countries like the US or UK. Other papers examine job search and mental health during a pandemic recession. Current and future work will be featured under :ref:`publications`.

data <https://covid-19-impact-lab.iza.org/en/app>`_. The data explorer contains 
survey results from March 2020 and will soon be updated to include more recent data.
