COVID-19 Impact Lab
===================

Covid-19 impact lab was initiated by a group of economists at Bonn. While our research projects usually take months or years to materialise, the situation in March 2020 prompted us to combine efforts in order to speed things up.

Our primary goal is to bring the first-order facts to the public and decision-makers quickly, who had to take decisions with far-reaching consequences without a reliable foundation in March 2020. Secondly, we will provide in-depth analyses of the data in order to better prepare for another crisis.


Our work comprises the following areas


**Data Collection**: We fielded a survey in the Dutch LISS panel specifically directed at .... In addition, we teamed up with GESIS and the UAS to harmonise questionnaires internationally and automated the process to get infection rates. We also provide an overview of publicly available :ref:`data`.

**Interactive Visualization**: We will build a dashboard that makes it easy to explore the corona related questions of the LISS panel interactively and without programming skills. Users can then either download plots to include them in their papers or auto-generate code to generate these plots in an automated fashion.


**Analysis Pipelines**: We want to publish results, the moment we get data. Thus we set up a robust analysis pipeline now and test it with simulated datasets.
