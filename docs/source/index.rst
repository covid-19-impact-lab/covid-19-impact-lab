CoViD-19 Impact Lab
===================

CoViD-19 and what it means for us personally, our loved ones, the economy and society in general is on everyone's mind. To give meaningful answers to these questions it is important to know what the population as a whole knows, believes and how people behave in response to the current pandemic. Our goal is to analyse the effects of the CoViD-19 crisis and countermeasures on people’s behaviour, fears, and beliefs. At short notice we aim to generate helpful insights from contemporaneous data and communicate them to decision-makers and the public. In the medium run, we will provide further in-depth analyses. `Our first survey <http://ftp.iza.org/dp13158.pdf>`_ reveals that low-income earners suffer most from the crisis  while high-paid workers benefit from the home office option. For further details `explore our data <https://covid-19-impact-lab.iza.org/en/app>`_.
