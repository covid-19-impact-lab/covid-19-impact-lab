CoViD-19 Impact Lab
===================

CoViD-19 and what it means for us personally, our loved ones, the economy, and society in general is on everyone's mind. To assess how CoViD-19 is impacting individuals, households, and communities, it is important to know what the population as a whole knows, believes, and how people behave in response to the current pandemic. In order to gain insights, we are running multiple surveys, thereby facilitating near-real-time monitoring of how people respond to the CoViD-19 crisis and the implemented countermeasures to the pandemic. At short notice, we aim to generate helpful insights from contemporaneous data and communicate them to decision-makers and the public. In the medium run, we will provide further in-depth analyses. `Our first paper <http://ftp.iza.org/dp13158.pdf>`_ reveals that low-income earners suffer most from the crisis while high-paid workers benefit from the home office option. For further details `explore our data <https://covid-19-impact-lab.iza.org/en/app>`_. Current and future work will be featured under :ref:`publications`.
