Datasets
========

By now there are quite a few established panels as well as new studies studying the the impact CoViD-19.
Here we list and document all datasets that we are aware of for researchers who are interested in working on CoViD-19's impact on our societies.
We only focus on datasets, so this section does not try to cover the many amazing visualizations out there.

As there are new studies being planned and being rolled out all the time,
do not hesitate make us aware of any new data sources that are still missing on this page.
To do so please contact `Klara Röhrl <https://github.com/roecla>`_ via Zulip or Email.

Social Science Datasets

The LISS Panel
===============

The `LISS panel <https://www.lissdata.nl/>`_ is a Dutch survey of 4500 households that have been interviewed regularly for over ten years on a large variety of topics.

So far, the following questionnaires on the CoViD-19 epidemic have been fielded in the LISS panel:

* 2-19 March 2020: A very early set of questions on risks of infection, illness, and being quarantined, designed by `Peter van de Velden <https://www.centerdata.nl/en/about-us/peter-van-der-velden>`__. `Questionnaire in English and Dutch <_static/Corona-virus-LISS-panel-early-March-2019.pdf>`__.

* 20-31 March 2020: A 15-minute questionnaire on a variety of topics:

  * Perceptions and behaviour regarding the medical risks associated with the coronavirus.
  * Assessments of various social distancing policies' effectiveness, support for and  compliance with these policies.
  * Changes in the work and childcare situation since the onset of the crisis.
  * Intentions and expectations regarding consumption/savings decisions, workplace  security, and the effectiveness of fiscal policy measures.
  * Mental health and a list of the biggest worries for the next four weeks.
  * Trust in the government and assessments on whether the government is taking too few or too many measures in various dimensions.

  Designed by our team, `(preliminary) English translation <_static/LISS_covid19_questionnaire_english_20200320_1.0.pdf>`__, `Dutch original <_static/LISS_covid19_questionnaire_dutch_20200320_1.0.pdf>`__.


Understanding America Survey
=============================

The `Understanding America Survey  <https://uasdata.usc.edu/>`_ included a questionnaire between 2020-03-10 and 2020-03-16 with over 5000 observations.
Information on the questionnaire can be found `here <https://uasdata.usc.edu/page/COVID-19+Corona+Virus>`__. Certainly more to come.


GESIS Panel
===========

The GESIS Panel is a survey administered by the Leibniz Institute of the Social Sciences in Mannheim, Germany. As of 2019, the panel comprises 5400 individuals. The survey is administered every two months. Surveys consist of a `longitudinal core study <https://www.gesis.org/en/gesis-panel/gesis-panel-home/longitudinal-core-study>`_ and additional submitted studies.

In late March 2020, the GESIS Panel conduced a Special Survey on the Coronavirus SARS-CoV 2 Outbreak in Germany. More information can be found `here <https://www.gesis.org/gesis-panel/coronavirus-outbreak/public-use-file-puf>`_.


Germany CoViD-19 Snapshot Monitoring
=====================================

This serial cross-sectional study monitors public perceptions of risk, protective and preparedness behaviours, public trust, as well as knowledge and misinformation to enable government spokespeople, the media, and health organizations to implement adequate responses in Germany.

More information can be found `here <http://dx.doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.2776>`__ and `here <https://www.uni-erfurt.de/kommunikationswissenschaft/profil/professuren/pidi/>`__.

International Survey on Coronavirus
===================================

https://covid19-survey.org/ — large-scale international study; anybody can participate, invitations via social media. In the field since 20 March. `English Questionnaire <https://osf.io/3sn2k/>`__.

Epidemiological Datasets
--------------------------

Country Time Series of Confirmed Cases and Deaths
==================================================

The John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering provides time series at the country level on this `GitHub repository <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>`__. Data is updated daily and available as .csv files.

Another `source <https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide>`_ for such data is the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

At the regional level, we are aware of the following data sources:

For Germany disaggregate data down to the "Landkreis" level can be queried from the
Robert-Koch-Institut `here <https://survstat.rki.de/Content/Query/Create.aspx>`__.
Note that the disaggregate cases do not add up to the numbers at the state and country level but only cover approximately 50 percent of cases.

For other countries we don't know of datasets that are maintained at the regional level. However, we are aware of a newssite following the cases at the state / region level for
`the USA <https://bnonews.com/index.php/2019/12/tracking-coronavirus-u-s-data/>`_,
`Canada <https://bnonews.com/index.php/2019/12/tracking-coronavirus-canada-data/>`_ and
`Australia <https://bnonews.com/index.php/2019/12/tracking-coronavirus-australia-data/>`_.

MIDAS Epidemiologic Model Estimates
=====================================

The MIDAS Coordination Center collects mostly peer-reviewed estimates for parameters central to modelling CoViD-19 epidemiologically. The data can be found on `this <https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19>`_ GitHub repository.


Transmission Data Using Genom Sequencing
=========================================

The `Nextstrain <https://nextstrain.org/ncov>`_ project's data on the transmission and strains of the novel coronavirus is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov>`_.
