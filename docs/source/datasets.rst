The `LISS panel <https://www.lissdata.nl/`_ is a Dutch survey of 4500 households that have been interviewed regularly for over ten years on a large variety of topics.

- beliefs about the extent of the epidemic, ways to fight it and its consequences
- behavior changes in response to the epidemic and policy measures

- what we use it for
