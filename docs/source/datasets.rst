The RKI ARS Data
=================

About 40% of laboratories in Germany report test results including several demographic characteristics such as gender, state and age group.
However, this data is only published in the form of weekly pdf reports.
For age groups we have converted this data to tabular data which can be downloaded `here <https://github.com/roecla/rki_ars_covid_test_data>`_.


.. Understanding America Survey
.. =============================

.. The `Understanding America Study <https://uasdata.usc.edu/>`_ is conducting the `UAS Understanding Coronavirus in America (“Covid”) Survey <https://uasdata.usc.edu/index.php>`_, which includes a national bi-weekly long-form survey and a weekly Los Angeles County short-form survey.

GESIS Panel
===========

The GESIS Panel is a survey administered by the Leibniz Institute of the Social Sciences in Mannheim, Germany. As of 2019, the panel comprises 5400 individuals. The survey is administered every two months. Surveys consist of a `longitudinal core study <https://www.gesis.org/en/gesis-panel/gesis-panel-home/longitudinal-core-study>`_ and additional submitted studies.

In late March 2020, the GESIS Panel conduced a Special Survey on the Coronavirus

A tracker of trackers: COVID-19 policy responses and data
============================================================

For a more extensive list of possible data sources, see Lukas Lehner's `tracker of trackers <https://lukaslehner.github.io/covid19policytrackers/>`_. The site offers a comprehensive overview of many policy trackers and dataset focusing on the coronavirus pandemic. The tracker has since been updated and is now available as the `Oxford Supertracker <https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/>`_.
