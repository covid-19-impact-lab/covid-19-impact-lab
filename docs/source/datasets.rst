Datasets
========

By now there are quite a few established panels as well as new studies studying the the impact Covid-19.
Here we list and document all datasets that we are aware of for researchers who are interested in working on Covid-19's impact on our societies.
We only focus on datasets, so this section does not try to cover the many amazing visualizations out there.

As there are new studies being planned and being rolled out all the time,
do not hesitate make us aware of any new data sources that are still missing on this page.
To do so please contact `Klara RÃ¶hrl <https://github.com/roecla>`_ via Zulip or Email.

Social Science Datasets

The LISS Panel
===============

The `LISS panel <https://www.lissdata.nl/>`_ is a Dutch survey of 4500 households that have been interviewed regularly for over ten years on a large variety of topics.

The LISS included a questionnaire on the Covid-19 epidemic between 2020-03-20 and 2020-03-31.

.. The questionnaire covered:
..
.. - beliefs about the extent of the epidemic, ways to fight it and its consequences
.. - behavior changes in response to the epidemic and policy measures
.. - support for hypothetical and satisfaction with implemented policy measures
.. - qualifications and willingness to support the health care system

An English translation of the questionnaire can be downloaded
:download:`here <../_static/translated_liss_covid_19-improved-version.pdf>` and 
the original Dutch version
:download:`here <LISS_covid19_questionnaire_dutch_20200320_1.0.pdf>`.


Understanding America Survey
=============================

The `Understanding America Survey  <https://uasdata.usc.edu/>`_ included a questionnaire between 2020-03-10 and 2020-03-16 with over 5000 observations.
Information on the questionnaire can be found `here <https://uasdata.usc.edu/page/COVID-19+Corona+Virus>`_.

Germany COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring
=====================================

This serial cross-sectional study monitors public perceptions of risk, protective and preparedness behaviours, public trust, as well as knowledge and misinformation to enable government spokespeople, the media, and health organizations to implement adequate responses in Germany.

More information can be found `here <http://dx.doi.org/10.23668/psycharchives.2776>`_ and `here <https://www.uni-erfurt.de/kommunikationswissenschaft/profil/professuren/pidi/>`_.

Epidemiological Datasets
--------------------------

Country Time Series of Confirmed Cases and Deaths
==================================================

The John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering provides time series at the country level on this `github repository <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>`_. Data is updated daily and available as .csv files.

Another `source <https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide>`_ for such data is the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

At the regional level, we are aware of the following data sources:

For Germany disaggregate data down to the "Landkreis" level can be queried from the
Robert-Koch-Institut `here <https://survstat.rki.de/Content/Query/Create.aspx>`_.
Note that the disaggregate cases do not add up to the numbers at the state and country level but only cover approximately 50 percent of cases.

For other countries we don't know of datasets that are maintained at the regional level. However, we are aware of a newssite following the cases at the state / region level for
`the USA <https://bnonews.com/index.php/2019/12/tracking-coronavirus-u-s-data/>`_,
`Canada <https://bnonews.com/index.php/2019/12/tracking-coronavirus-canada-data/>`_ and
`Australia <https://bnonews.com/index.php/2019/12/tracking-coronavirus-australia-data/>`_.

MIDAS Epidemiologic Model Estimates
=====================================

The MIDAS Coordination Center collects mostly peer-reviewed estimates for parameters central to modelling Covid-19 epidemiologically. The data can be found on this `github repository <https://github.com/midas-network/COVID-19>`_.


Transmission Data Using Genom Sequencing
=========================================

The `Nextstrain <https://nextstrain.org/ncov>`_ project's data on the transmission and strains of the novel coronavirus is available on this`github repository <https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov>`_.
