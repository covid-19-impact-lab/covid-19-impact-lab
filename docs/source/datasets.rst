Datasets
========

By now there are quite a few established panels as well as new studies studying the Covid-19's impact. 
Here we list and document all that we are aware of for researchers who are interested in working on Covid-19's impact on our societies. We only focus on datasets, so this section does not try to cover the many amazing visualizations out there. 

As there are new studies being planned and being rolled out, do not hesitate make us aware of new studies and datasets. 
To do so please contact `Klara RÃ¶hrl <https://github.com/roecla>`_ via Zulip or Email.
