LISS
====

The `LISS panel <https://www.lissdata.nl/`_ is a Dutch survey of 4500 households that have been interviewed regularly for over ten years on a large variety of topics.

Thanks to funding by the `German Research Funding through CRCTR224 <https://www.crctr224.de/en`_ the LISS included a questionnaire on the Covid-19 epidemic between 2020-03-20 and 2020-03-31. The questionnaire covered:

- beliefs about the extent of the epidemic, ways to fight it and its consequences
- behavior changes in response to the epidemic and policy measures
- support for hypothetical and satisfaction with implemented policy measures
- qualifications and willingness to support the health care system

- what we use it for
