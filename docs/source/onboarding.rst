Dutch Translators
-------------------
At the moment we are looking for **Dutch native speakers** who would like to help us with the translation of our `data exploration tool <https://covid-19-impact-lab.iza.org/app>`_ into Dutch.

There are three tables. Each has columns that end in ``_english``. These need translation.

The following comments apply:

- Only rows where ``nice_name_english`` is not missing need translation (if that column exists else everything needs a translation).
- You can save the table in any file you like but please send us a .csv, separated by semi-colons (;). That means, do not use semi-colons in any translation!
- You can copy and paste from the original Dutch questionnaire where applicable.
- The entries in the ``nice_name`` column must be very short. No more than 18 characters, preferably less than 15.

If you are interested, please contact us and we will send you the tables and answer any questions you may have. Your help is greatly appreciated!
