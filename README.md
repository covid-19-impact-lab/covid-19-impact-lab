# COVID-19 Impact Lab

Initiated by economists based at the [University of Bonn](https://econ.uni-bonn.de) and the [Open Source Economics initiative](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics),

Our mission is provide timely analysis of data to understand the impacts of the Coronavirus crisis on social and economic life. In order to do so, we collect microdata and perform the analyses using open-sourced, standardised analysis pipelines. This makes them easily usable by others. Our outreach activities are directed towars the general public, towards policy-makers, and of course, the scientific community.

We believe that each single piece of societal effort contributes to an overarching solution. We face this problem together, and we will solve it together. If you want to be part of it do not hesitate to contact the community manager [Annica Gehlen](https://github.com/amageh) to receive your onboarding protocol. Please indicate with which skill sets you are planning to contribute towards our work.
