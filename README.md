# COVID-19 Impact Lab

Our goal is to analyse the effect of the current crisis and countermeasures on people's behaviour, fears, and beliefs. Our short-run goal is to generate helpful insights from contemporaneous data; we will communicate them as quickly as possible to the public and decision-makers. In the medium run, we will provide further in-depth analyses to be communicated in the usual scientific way.

If you are interested to learn more about our goals and research or want to contribute you can find all necessary information [here](https://covid-19-impact-lab.readthedocs.io)
