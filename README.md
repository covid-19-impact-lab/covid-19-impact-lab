# CoViD-19 Impact Lab

CoViD-19 Impact Lab was started in mid-March 2020 by a group of economists at Bonn and now consists of students and more senior researchers from several institutions like the University of Mannheim, the University of Lausanne, Tilburg University, and the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA).

To assess how CoViD-19 is impacting individuals, households, and communities, we were running a panel data collection in the Netherlands, thereby facilitating near-real-time monitoring of how people respond to the CoViD-19 crisis. On the one hand, we aim to quickly generate insights from contemporaneous data and communicate them to decision-makers and the public. On the other hand, we will continue to provide in-depth analyses of mechanisms using microeconomic and microeconometric methods.

In our first papers, we look at the driving forces of working hours reductions, job search and mental health during a pandemic recession. In a simulation model, we explore the effects of different containment policies on infection numbers. For further details check our [website](https://covid-19-impact-lab.readthedocs.io)
