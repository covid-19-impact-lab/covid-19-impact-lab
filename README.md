# COVID-19 Impact Lab

This repository serves as the umbrella project to represent the data collection and analysis efforts of the **COVID-19 Impact Lab**, an interdisciplinary group of researchers from the University of Bonn, the [Open Source Economics initiative](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics), [tbd], and [tbd].

We work on innovative solutions to tackle the societal challenge of the COVID-19 spread. We aim to provide answers from the viewpoint of Economics. This includes, but is not limited to: 

- Visualizations on how many people in a specified region/county are vulnerable and/or support certain measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
- How many people are changing their behavior in response to COVID-19 announcements?

 We believe that each single piece of societal effort contributes to an overarching solution. We face this problem together, and we will solve it together. If you want to be part of it do not hesitate to contact the community manager [Annica Gehlen](https://github.com/amageh) to receive your onboarding protocol. Please indicate with which skill sets you are planning to contribute towards our work.
